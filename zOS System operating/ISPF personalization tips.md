# ISPF personalization tips

## `SWAPBAR` - multi-tabs for logical screens
`SWAPBAR` will display all the active logical session names at bottom of the screen. To run, type in the command line:
```haskell
SWAPBAR ON
```

Usage tips:
* Enter `START` in any ISPF screen to start a new logical session. You can `START` up to 8 screens.
  * Entry for your current session will have an asterisk (*) at the first characterâ€™s position
* To navigate between sessions use the **PF9** key
  * You can enter the number of a specific session in the command line (for example, 3) and press **PF9**.
  * You can type `LIST` at the command line and press **PF9**. A list of sessions will be displayed. To go to a specific session, type `S` in front of it
  * All sessions are point-and-shoot. So that you can simply point your cursor to the session name which you want to pull up and then press the **Enter key**

* To close a logical session, enter `=X`

## Home button takes the cursor to start of command line
 1. On the PRIMARY OPTION MENU (main ISPF screen) select **Option 0 (Settings)**. 
 2. If the "**Command line at bottom**" line has a "/" in front of it, remove the "/".
 2. Here there is an option "**Tab to action bar choices**". Deselect that option.

## Pointer to cursor position
